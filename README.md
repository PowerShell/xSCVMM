## Examples

Two example configurations are included in the Examples folder within the module.
Both examples also use the **xSQLServer** module.

### Single Server Installation

SCVMM-SingleServer.ps1 installs all VMM roles including prerequisites and SQL on a single server.

### Separate SQL

SCVMM-SeperateSQL.ps1 installs all VMM roles on one server and SQL on a seperate server.

Notes:

Both examples require the use of [Windows Management Framework (WMF) 5.0 Preview](http://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=398175).

Both examples use the exact same Configuration and just modify the behavior based on input ConfigurationData.

In the Examples folder you will see a version of each file with "-TP" appended to the name.
These are the equivalent examples for deployment of System Center Technical Preview on Windows Server Technical Preview.

Since the System Center 2012 R2 Virtual Machine Manager installer for the management server restarts the Windows Remote Management service, if you are using -Verbose -Wait to see the progress of the configuration you will lose the connection to the VMM server during deployment.
However, the configuration will continue and complete without further display.
